#### I'm a Systems Engineer with a background in leadership, project management, and all things web development. Over time, I've worn many hats: from IT Director and Scrum Master to Project Leader and Web Developer. I've got a knack for strategic planning, managing IT budgets, crafting tech solutions, and leading teams with agile methods. I've built custom websites using cool tools like HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, react.js, node.js, PHP, and Python. Plus, I've played around with content management systems like WordPress and Shopify. I'm also into optimizing websites, and I know my way around hosting and databases. My aim? Keep growing, come up with cool tech solutions, and help organizations thrive.

#### Web development and design? Totally my jam. I'm into color theory, love the flow of harmonic movements, and geek out over algorithm logic.
